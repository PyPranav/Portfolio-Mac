# 🚀 MacOS-Themed Portfolio  

Welcome to my **personal portfolio**, designed to mimic **MacOS** for an interactive and immersive experience. This project showcases my **skills, projects, and creativity** with a fully responsive and dynamic interface.  

## 🎨 Features  
- **MacOS-Inspired UI** – Windowed apps, a dock, a menu bar, and smooth transitions.  
- **Dynamic Apps** – Each app highlights a different skill or project.  
- **Custom Animations** – Hand-crafted animations for smooth interactions.  
- **Easter Eggs & Fun Details** – Explore and discover hidden surprises!  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework)  
- **Backend:** [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (Python Microframework)  
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for efficient and responsive design  
- **Animations:** Fully custom-built animations 

## 💡 Inspiration & Why I Built This  
I've always been a fan of **MacOS's clean, intuitive, and polished design**. So, I thought—why not turn my portfolio into a **fully interactive desktop environment**? This project was a way for me to combine **UI/UX design, frontend development, and backend logic** into a fun and engaging experience.  

Beyond just a portfolio, this serves as a **sandbox** for me to experiment with **performance optimization, animation techniques, and interactive web experiences**. Every part of this project—from the **window management** to the **animations**—is handcrafted to mimic the real MacOS feel.
